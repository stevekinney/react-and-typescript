## Who Is This For?

This workshop is for anyone who is interested in learning how to use TypeScript with React. While there is no expectation that you're familiar with TypeScript, we're not going to be covering the basics of TypeScript directly. Instead, we'll be learning it within the context of building simple components in React. If you're familiar with building React applications using TypeScript already, some of the content that we're going to cover is going to be things you already know. That said, I have a suspicion that you'll pick up a few tips and tricks along the way. I also hope that it will reinforce the fundamentals for you.

## Code Examples and Project Starters

Clone [this repository][projects] and run `npx recursive-install` to install all of the dependencies.

## Your Set Up

You don't need a lot to get rocking and/or rolling with this course. In fact, most of the examples and exercises have versions that are hosted on [CodeSandbox][]. So, you probably only need a browsers and if you're reading this, you likely already have one of those.

But, let's assume that you also want to work on some of this stuff locally as well. In that case, you're going to want to have the following installed:

- [NodeJS][]. This course was tested using the latest LTS release of Node at the time (e.g. 14), but it honestly shouldn't matter much. I recommend using [nvm][] to manage which version of Node you're using.
- You're going to need an editor of some kind. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code][vscode]. But, you likely already have opinions on this topic.

## My Set Up

In case you're morbidly curious about what I'm using as we spend the next several hours together, here is a quick rundown of my setup.

- **Font**: [Fira Code][firacode]. It's basically a version of Mozilla's [Fira Mono][firamono], but with fancy ligatures.
- **Theme**: [Tomorrow and Tomorrow Night][tomorrow]. Why? Because I've always used it and I'm very lazy.
- **Plugins**: I don't install a lot of plugins, but here are some of the ones that I like: [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

## Who am I?

Hello! My name is [Steve Kinney][steve] and I'm the front-end architect at [Twilio][twilio]—we're the company that sends text messages and emails and whatnot. I help lead all of our front-end and user-interface efforts at the company. Pretty much everything we do is built on top of React and uses TypeScript.

In the past, I started the front-end engineering program at the [Turing School of Software and Design][turing], started a JavaScript conference called [DinosaurJS][dino], and wrote a book on [Electron][electron].

I live in Denver, Colorado. If you are so inclined to find me on the Internet, you may do so at the following locations:
