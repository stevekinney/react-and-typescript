(But, that answer probably isn't good enough for your curiousity, is it?)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interfaces are commonly used for defining the shape of objects and classes.</li>\n<li>You might however just want to define a type of function or a type alias, types are cool too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces\">Microsoft's TypeScript Handbook</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>User interfaces for public APIs since the consumer can then extend them if needed.</li>\n<li>Consider using <code class=\"language-text\">type</code> for your React Component Props and State, for consistency and because it is more constrained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TL; DR you can extend interfaces. This is convenient, bit it can also make things more complicated. It's up to you to decide if this is a think that makes your life better or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/karoljmajewski/status/1082413696075382785\">Here</a> is a fun chart to look at.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwV-oOsXcAIct2q?format=jpg&#x26;name=medium\" alt=\"Types Versus Interfaces\"></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/types-versus-interfaces","title":"Types Versus Interfaces","order":"10B","section":"Appendix","description":"What are some of the differences between types and interfaces?"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5D","path":"/refactoring-color-inputs","title":"Refactoring the Color Inputs"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9F","path":"/dependent-props","title":"Demanding Props Based on Other Props"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9A","path":"/limiting-props","title":"Limiting Props a Component Can Take Based on Other Props"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9B","path":"/polymorphic-components","title":"Polymorphic Components with TypeScript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9C","path":"/polymorphic-components-exercise","title":"Polymorphic Components (Exercise)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9D","path":"/polymorphic-components-solution","title":"Polymorphic Components (Solution)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6C","path":"/utility-types-character-cards","title":"Refactoring the Character Cards with Utility Types"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3D","path":"/class-based-components","title":"Typing Class-based Components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/commonly-used-props","title":"Commonly-Used Props"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5B","path":"/context-api","title":"The Context API"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5C","path":"/context-with-reducer","title":"The Context API with State Management"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3E","path":"/dog-facts","title":"Exercise: Dog Facts"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3E","path":"/forms-and-events","title":"Forms and Events (Exercise)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9E","path":"/overloads","title":"Function Overloads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/generics","title":"Working with Generics"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/higher-order-components-exercise","title":"Higher Order Components with TypeScript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8C","path":"/higher-order-components-solution","title":"Higher Order Components (Solution)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8A","path":"/higher-order-components","title":"Higher Order Components with TypeScript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10A","path":"/migration","title":"Migrating From JavaScript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/passing-dipatch","title":"Prologue: Passing Dispatch as a Props"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/reducers-exercise","title":"Reducers (Exercise)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/reducers-solution","title":"Reducers (Solution)"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/reducers","title":"Typing Reducers"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/refactoring-from-proptypes","title":"Refactoring from PropTypes"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1B","path":"/sales-pitch","title":"Why Use TypeScript?
